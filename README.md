Develop a basic Real-Time Chat application.

The propose of this chat app is to enable any user to participate in a free, open chat channel.
Any user can enter the application and start chatting with other users in a public chat channel.

You need to develop this application using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and Node.js.

Must-have requirements:
    1.    On the client-side use only Vanilla Javascript - No jQuery or any libraries/front-end frameworks.
    2.    On the server-side using Node.js - You can use a WebSocket module/library as per your choice.
    3.    As long as the browser is open, show the whole history from the point the user has joined.

You don't have to implement persistent storage, you may if you want.
The UI should be a simple chat interface with a place to type and send a message, a place to see all of the messages in the channel, and a place to see all of the currently active participants.

It's up to you to add more functionality as you want.
Anyhow, It's important that you will first focus on the Must Have requirements.
 
Send me a zip with all the app files after you finish. Please try to send it until Sunday 11/04.

If you have any questions feel free to message me (using Spike of course ðŸ˜‰) and I'll answer ASAP.

Good luck!
